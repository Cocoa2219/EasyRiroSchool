# EasyRiroSchool

**EasyRiroSchool** is a simple and easy-to-use RiroSchool .NET library that allows you to easily fetch data from RiroSchool.
Since RiroSchool uses Server Side Rendering (SSR), it is difficult to fetch pure structured data from it. **EasyRiroSchool** solves this problem by scraping the HTML of the page and extracting the data you need.
